Thank you for reviwing our app. But we have some appeal for rejection. Please read our explanation as below.

Section 1: All About the Tokyo App Experiences
==========

Overall design principles: Tokyo  
This application is for the music event “Tokyo 0505”.  

http://tokyo-0505.cs8.biz/  
http://tokyo-bb.cs8.biz/  

This is a large-scale event which will be over 1000 visitors.  
This is the event of net label and visitors are heavily using social media.  
So we want to provide location-aware social experience sharing on the event using this app.  

  Since the concept of event “Tokyo”, We decided the overall UX and visual design concept to Tokyo.  Tokyo has mysterious roots and global feature.  We want visitors to immerse both the event and Tokyo.  So we conducted every features on the map with icons.

1) Share - Tokyo metaphor
-----

Why you need to share location on music club event?  There are many reasons.

- to find friends
- to find famous persons
- to inform and see what is happening on the event
- to advertise my favorite artists


  To accomplish these, the simplest and the most elegant way is showing people on the map.  Anyway if we want to see our shared location, on the very crowded event, the better way is to “glance”.  

  This event treats the club’s location as a point of Greater Tokyo City(Dai Tokyo Shi).  Visitors experiences as if they spread to the Tokyo.  A visitor from Tokyo feel familiar with the virtual Tokyo, and it is useful to call their location as a region of Tokyo.  A visitor from other prefectures can virtually visit famous areas in Tokyo.

  Japanese popular fiction 帝都物語(Teito Monogatari) was a story of a magic side of Tokyo.  Traditionally Tokyo is received as a magic city like 風水(Feng shui) or 龍脈(Dragon Road).  Each areas and roads has magic meaning and if we across the border, something happen.  Clubs has the same feature. Crowds in front of the DJ has a power like magic.  This app connects Tokyo and the club.

  On the other hand, Tokyo is a global city.  we used iBeacon and assigned to real Tokyo location.  these are the center of the areas, and these are global.  So we used “bacon” for “beacon” icon, the most popular food of the USA.

2) Communication - Port metaphor
-----

  Furthermore, We added a new feature that allows to compose tweet with floor room name as hashtag.
  It makes users easily can post twitter message with themselves current location as hashtag.

  Visitor can:

- Share their experiences with iBeacon location(by Hash Tag correspond to the iBeacon location)
- See the Twitter timeline of the specified location of the event(by Hash Tag)


  These are common feature, but it is more convenient than changing app on the crowded situation like a club.  

  All communication features can accessed on the fish and bacon.  Another element that makes Tokyo is Sea.  Japan is an island country and Tokyo Bay is the most important gateway to outside, as a hub of trades and communications.  Now, the Internet age, the importance of sea is increasing.  Submarine cables connects all over the world, and twitter.  So we used fish as a metaphor of the sea, communication.

3) Meet with Superstars - Fish metaphor
-----

  We also music provide function that when visitors meet with superstars, they can get extra music tracks and receive special messages via twitter DM.

  Some kind of fishes like Tuna make an excursion in the sea.  Superstars are busy so they also make excursion in the club.  So we make them have iBeacon and provide an extra music track and message when visitors meet with them.  This feature is of course accessed from the fish and tracks are unlocked on the background, although they meet superstars without launching apps.

  This app using Twitter Account Integration not only authentication but sending direct messages as above.


4) Navigation
-----

  We have 2 floors on the club.  So we placed timetable icons on the east and west Tokyo.  These are expressed as clock icon.

Section 2: Feature List
==========

The feature provide by this app is as below:

 - Show a map of event site
 - Show user’s own location and other user’s location (as twitter icon)
 - Search tweet locally by hashtag (from bacon annotation callout)
 - Show timetable of event (from clock annotation callout)
 - Compose tweet with current location hashtag (from fish button)
 - Detect user has meet with specific person and
    - send direct message (works automatically)
    - show log that who met (from fish button) 
 

  We believe that these features enriches visitors’ experience and make their time gorgeous.  This app has great bacon, fish, and clock.  This is Tokyo.
